# Noumenex
## Metaverse language

### Reason

Process optimization for bridging experience between two nodes (e.g. persons) including the direct passing of a complex phenomenon that cannot easily be expressed in a word.

Problem: I want to express an idea like "the cat is on the table"
Solution: I use my mouth to utter the words "the cat is on the table." Other person hears the phrase and understands that the cat is on the table.
Solution map:  (node1((idea (noun(location)) -> (mouth(phrase))) -> (node2(ear(brain-interpreter)) -> (idea (noun(location)))
Additional context: both parties (node1 and node2) must have already seen "the cat" and have a mental model of what that describes. 

For the solution map we can optimize for two functions, fidelity and speed. Fidelity is defined as the extent to which the object (in this case (noun(location) ) is the same in the original node (mind of person 1) and in the second node (mind of person 2). In this case, various testing functions are possible. For example, asking the question to both parties: Where is the cat?  What is on the table? This forces the knowledge transfer function to an effectively binary conclusion.  

Speed is the time it takes to finish the process. In this case, a matter of seconds, probably under 10 seconds. However, this can always be optimized for.

Now the problem is that with more complex ideas (more strictly "noumena") both of these functions are harder to express. The testing function is harder to bring to a binary ouput and the time to express increases. 

Problem: I want to express an idea like "the dodecahedron is inside the third metaverse on the left"
Solution: I create Rendering through a set of objects and rendering engines, I load them into virtual reality glasses. I give them to other person. They put on the glasses and observe. 
Solution map:  (node1((idea (noun(location)) -> (rendering engine(object))) -> (node2(vr-goggles(eyes(brain-interpreter)) -> (idea (noun(location)))

In the first example we used standard motor functions and sensory organs with the middleware layer of soundwaves which both our vocal organs and auditory organs are preconfigured for. In this second example we have a more complex middleware layer that consists of a mix of proprietary hardware and software which has a similar function, namely transmitting complex data forms into a visually accessible format. 

As with our two optimization parameters from the first example, fidelity and speed, we are now in the place where we can make reliable comparisons between different media types and comparison mechanisms. Moreover, these can be optimized for. 

Capital, a capital deployment and organizational cycle can be designed that exists with the optimization for these variables.
