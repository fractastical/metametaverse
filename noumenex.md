# Noumenex
## Metaverse language

### Reason

Process optimization for bridging experience between two nodes (e.g. persons) including the direct passing of a complex phenomenon that cannot easily be expressed in a word.

Problem: I want to express an idea like "the cat is on the table"
Solution: I use my mouth to utter the words "the cat is on the table." Other person hears the phrase and understands that the cat is on the table.
Solution map:  (node1((idea (noun(location)) -> (mouth(phrase))) -> (node2(ear(brain-interpreter)) -> (idea (noun(location)))

For the solution map we can optimize for two functions, fidelity and speed. Fidelity is defined as the extent to which the object (in this case (noun(location) ) is the same in the original node (mind of person 1) and in the second node (mind of person 2). In this case, various testing functions are possible. For example, asking the question to both parties: Where is the cat?  What is on the table? This forces the knowledge transfer fucttion to an effectively binary conclusion.  

Speed is the time it takes to finish the process. In this case, a matter of seconds, probably under 10 seconds. However, this can always be optimized for.

Now the problem is that with more complex ideas (more strictly "noumena") both of these functions are harder to express. The testing function is harder to bring to a binary ouput and the time to express increases. 

Problem: I want to express an idea like "the dodecahedron is inside the third metaverse on the left"
Solution: I create Rendering through a set of objects and rendering engines, I load them into virtual reality glasses. I give them to other person. They put on the glasses and observe. 
Solution map:  (node1((idea (noun(location)) -> (rendering engine(object))) -> (node2(vr-goggles(eyes(brain-interpreter)) -> (idea (noun(location)))
