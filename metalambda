Metalambda is a self-evolving and mutating set of lambda functions (i.e. cellular automata) with a specific ruleset for their permutations.

Specifcally, a metalambda begins with a six character seed which the control functions are passed in the format AABBCC

AA - functions for determining the directionality and search function 
BB - functions for determining the fight or flight or merge style when encountering other lifeforms  
CC - functions for determining the genetic propogation style 

Addtionally, CA are put in a simulated environment and tested against each other with a log of their victories and defeates. Winning lambdas are recorded and mutated with respect to certain variables. 

(i.e. AA +/- rand % 10, BB +/- rand % 10, CC +/- rand % 10)

This allows the lambda to create children that keep core parts of its genetic sequence but also that has some potentially advantagous variablity.
