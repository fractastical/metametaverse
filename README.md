# Meta Metaverse
## play to earn metaverse building game


Meta Metaverse is a 360 degree virtual reality map with digital asset backing in which each land mass is a 100x100x100 land mass which be can subdivided and developed at multiple scale factors. This effectively makes it like the fractal zoom of metaverses. Each landmass is anchored to a star and the distance from the star can be variable and determined by the star owner. 

We are focusing on high quality voxel art and are currently onboarding artists. 

Like other metaverses, there is a proximity function to the core (i.e. star) whereby various cubes are more or less distant from the core and thus take longer to travel to. This makes land that is closer to naturally more valuable. For assessing distance, we plan to sell it at a certain distance but make the distance able to be able to be created algorithmically (i.e. the distance can be a function of land value, amount of foot traffic on the land, etc.) and defined by the starâ€™s owner. 

In the process of auditing other metaverses we learned that many of them have very limited upgradability due to hard coded nature of the feature set, which prompted some work towards a meta language to describe transforms and pathways inside this metaverse, including the possibility of multiple rendering engines and objects which are loaded from different data stores which may also have different access control layers. In short, if you have portals (i.e. places that open up from one spot and teleport you somewhere else, including to different zoom levels) then you then all locations can be described as sets of vectors (i.e. something could exist in a completely different metaverse but so long as there is a pathway to a portal you can describe the end location). Additionally, you can potentially define access controls and load time rendering instructions. 

In addition to land display, we are actively working on several other adjacent projects: 

Metameta lang - a language for developing transforms to reality to allow a dyanmic upgrade path and location for metaverses https://github.com/fractastical/etherea/blob/master/metametalang.md
MetaBrow - a wallet for storing and displaying metaverse related assets.
